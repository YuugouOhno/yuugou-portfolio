# AR Target Files

This directory should contain the MindAR compiled target files.

## Required Files

- `business-card.mind` - Compiled MindAR target file for the business card

## How to Create the Target File

1. Prepare your business card image (PNG or JPG)
   - High contrast images work best
   - Recommended size: 1000x600 pixels or similar
   - Avoid solid colors or simple patterns

2. Go to the MindAR Image Target Compiler:
   https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile/

3. Upload your business card image

4. Download the generated `.mind` file

5. Rename it to `business-card.mind` and place it in this directory

## Tips for Good Tracking

- Use images with lots of unique features and textures
- Avoid reflective or glossy surfaces on the actual card
- Good lighting helps with detection
- The card should have distinct visual elements
